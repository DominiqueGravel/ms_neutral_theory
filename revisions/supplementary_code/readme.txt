#--------------------------------------
Files: 5 separate files accompany the paper:

spatial_gcraphs.R provides functions to generate random spatial networks.

patch_model.R provides a function to run spatially explicit patch dynamics 

lottery_model.R provides a function to run the individual based lottery model. The model will be neutral if the environment is spatially homogeneous or if the niche breadth tends to infinity.

examples.R provides examples of individual runs for each model

simulations.R provides the code for the simulations and figures used for the paper.

#--------------------------------------
Package:

The package 'vegan' is required to execute the code 'simulations.R'
