Contents
==========

5 separate files accompany the paper:

1. spatial_gcraphs.R provides functions to generate random spatial networks.

2. patch_model.R provides a function to run spatially explicit patch dynamics 

3. lottery_model.R provides a function to run the individual based lottery model. The model will be neutral if the environment is spatially homogeneous or if the niche breadth tends to infinity.

4. examples.R provides examples of individual runs for each model

5. simulations.R provides the code for the simulations and figures used for the paper.

Dependencies
==========

The package 'vegan' is required to execute the code 'simulations.R'
