  \field{abstract}{%
  The patterns of abundance generated by a simple stochastic
  birth-death-immigration model are described in order to characterize the
  diversity of neutral communities of ecologically equivalent species.
  Diversity is described by species number S and the variance of frequency or
  log abundance q approximately. The frequency distribution of abundance is
  very generally lognormal, skewed to the left by immigration and resembling
  descriptions of natural communities. Increased immigration and community size
  always cause S to increase. Their effect on q approximately is more
  complicated, but given biologically reasonable assumptions, S and q
  approximately will be positively correlated in most circumstances. Larger
  samples contain more species; the graph of log S on log individuals,
  equivalent to a species-area curve, is generally convex upward but becomes
  linear with a slope of about +0.25 when immigration is low and births exceed
  deaths. When individuals invade a new, vacant environment, both S and q
  approximately increase through time. Thus, a positive correlation between S
  and q approximately will usually be generated when sites of differing size or
  age are surveyed. At equilibrium, communities maintain roughly constant
  levels of S and q approximately but change in composition through time;
  composition may remain similar, however, for many generations. Many prominent
  patterns observed in natural communities can therefore be generated by a
  strictly neutral model. This does not show that community structure is
  determined exclusively by demographic stochasticity, but rather demonstrates
  the necessity for an appropriate null model when functional hypotheses are
  being tested.%

  The central themes of community ecology-distribution, abundance, and
  diversity-display strongly marked and very general patterns. These include
  the log-normal distribution of abundance, the relation between range and
  abundance, the species-area law, and the turnover of species composition.
  Each pattern is the subject of a large literature that interprets it in terms
  of ecological processes, typically involving the sorting of differently
  specialized species onto heterogeneous landscapes. All of these patterns can
  be shown to arise, however, from neutral community models in which all
  individuals have identical properties, as the consequence of local dispersal
  alone. This implies, at the least, that functional interpretations of these
  patterns must be reevaluated. More fundamentally, neutral community models
  provide a general theory for biodiversity and conservation biology capable of
  predicting the fundamental processes and patterns of community ecology.%

  Spatial heterogeneity of ecological structures originates either from the
  physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes. In
  both cases, spatial structuring plays a functional role in ecosystems.
  Ecological models should explicitly take into account the spatial structure
  of ecosystems. In previous work, we used a polynomial function of the
  geographic coordinates of the sampling sites to model broad-scale spatial
  variation in a canonical (regression-type) modelling context. In this paper,
  we propose a method for detecting and quantifying spatial patterns over a
  wide range of scales. This is obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of a
  truncated matrix of geographic distances among the sampling sites. The
  eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used as spatial
  descriptors in regression or canonical analysis. This method can be applied
  to any set of sites providing a good coverage of the geographic sampling
  area. This paper investigates the behaviour of the method using numerical
  simulations and an artificial pseudo-ecological data set of known
  properties.%

  A method is proposed to partition the variation of species abundance data
  into independent components: pure spatial, pure environmental, spatial
  component of environmental influence, and undetermined. The new method uses
  pre—existing techniques and computer programs of canonical ordination. The
  intrinsic spatial component of community structure is partialled out of the
  species—environment relationship in order to see if the environmental
  control model still holds. The method is illustrated using oribatid mites in
  a peat blanket, forest vegetation data, and aquatic heterotrophic bacteria.
  In this latter example, the new method is shown to be complementary to
  another approach based on partial Mantel tests. See full-text article at

  Ecology Letters (2012) ABSTRACT: Although abiotic factors, together with
  dispersal and biotic interactions, are often suggested to explain the
  distribution of species and their abundances, species distribution models
  usually focus on abiotic factors only. We propose an integrative framework
  linking ecological theory, empirical data and statistical models to
  understand the distribution of species and their abundances together with the
  underlying community assembly dynamics. We illustrate our approach with 21
  plant species in the French Alps. We show that a spatially nested modelling
  framework significantly improves the model's performance and that the spatial
  variations of species presence-absence and abundances are predominantly
  explained by different factors. We also show that incorporating abiotic,
  dispersal and biotic factors into the same model bring new insights to our
  understanding of community assembly. This approach, at the crossroads between
  community ecology and biogeography, is a promising avenue for a better
  understanding of species co-existence and biodiversity distribution.%

  Biological communities often occur in spatially structured habitats where
  connectivity directly affects dispersal and metacommunity processes. Recent
  theoretical work suggests that dispersal constrained by the connectivity of
  specific habitat structures, such as dendrites like river networks, can
  explain observed features of biodiversity, but direct evidence is still
  lacking. We experimentally show that connectivity per se shapes diversity
  patterns in microcosm metacommunities at different levels. Local dispersal in
  isotropic lattice landscapes homogenizes local species richness and leads to
  pronounced spatial persistence. On the contrary, dispersal along dendritic
  landscapes leads to higher variability in local diversity and among-community
  composition. Although headwaters exhibit relatively lower species richness,
  they are crucial for the maintenance of regional biodiversity. Our results
  establish that spatially constrained dendritic connectivity is a key factor
  for community composition and population persistence.%

  Patterns of biodiversity predicted by the neutral theory rely on a simple
  phenomenological model of speciation. To further investigate the effect of
  speciation on neutral biodiversity, we analyze a spatially explicit neutral
  model based on population genetics. We define the metacommunity as a system
  of populations exchanging migrants, and we use this framework to introduce
  speciation with little or no gene flow (allopatric and parapatric
  speciation). We find that with realistic mutation rates, our metacommunity
  model driven by neutral processes cannot support more than a few species.
  Adding natural selection in the population genetics of speciation increases
  the number of species in the metacommunity, but the level of diversity found
  in the Barro Colorado Island is difficult to reach.%

  A central goal of conservation science is to identify the most important
  habitat patches for maintaining biodiversity on a landscape. Spatial
  biodiversity patterns are often used for such assessments, and patches that
  harbor unique diversity are generally prioritized over those with high
  community similarity to other areas. This places an emphasis on biodiversity
  representation, but removing a patch can have cascading effects on
  biodiversity persistence in the remaining ecological communities.
  Metacommunity theory provides a mechanistic route to the linking of
  biodiversity patterns on a landscape with the subsequent dynamics of
  diversity loss after habitat is degraded. Using spatially explicit neutral
  theory, I focus on the situation where spatial patterns of diversity and
  similarity are generated by the structure of dispersal networks and not
  environmental gradients. I find that gains in biodiversity representation are
  nullified by losses in persistence, and as a result the effects of removing a
  patch on metacommunity diversity are essentially independent of
  complementarity or other biodiversity patterns. In this scenario, maximizing
  protected area and not biodiversity representation is the key to maintaining
  diversity in the long term. These results highlight the need for a broader
  understanding of how conservation paradigms perform under different models of
  metacommunity dynamics.%

  Biologists seek an understanding of the processes underlying spatial
  biodiversity patterns. Neutral theory links those patterns to dispersal,
  speciation and community drift. Here, we advance the spatially explicit
  neutral model by representing the metacommunity as a network of smaller
  communities. Analytic theory is presented for a set of equilibrium diversity
  patterns in networks of communities, facilitating the exploration of
  parameter space not accessible by simulation. We use this theory to evaluate
  how the basic properties of a metacommunity - connectivity, size, and
  speciation rate - determine overall metacommunity gamma-diversity, and how
  that is partitioned into alpha- and beta-components. We find spatial
  structure can increase gamma-diversity relative to a well-mixed model, even
  when theta is held constant. The magnitude of deviations from the well-mixed
  model and the partitioning into alpha- and beta-diversity is related to the
  ratio of migration and speciation rates. gamma-diversity scales linearly with
  metacommunity size even as alpha- and beta-diversity scale nonlinearly with
  size.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography is increasingly
  accepted as an informative null model of community composition and dynamics.
  It has successfully produced macro-ecological patterns such as species-area
  relationships and species abundance distributions. However, the models
  employed make many unrealistic auxiliary assumptions. For example, the
  popular spatially implicit version assumes a local plot exchanging migrants
  with a large panmictic regional source pool. This simple structure allows
  rigorous testing of its fit to data. In contrast, spatially explicit models
  assume that offspring disperse only limited distances from their parents, but
  one cannot as yet test the significance of their fit to data. Here we compare
  the spatially explicit and the spatially implicit model, fitting the
  most-used implicit model (with two levels, local and regional) to data
  simulated by the most-used spatially explicit model (where offspring are
  distributed about their parent on a grid according to either a radially
  symmetric Gaussian or a 'fat-tailed' distribution). Based on these fits, we
  express spatially implicit parameters in terms of spatially explicit
  parameters. This suggests how we may obtain estimates of spatially explicit
  parameters from spatially implicit ones. The relationship between these
  parameters, however, makes no intuitive sense. Furthermore, the spatially
  implicit model usually fits observed species-abundance distributions better
  than those calculated from the spatially explicit model's simulated data.
  Current spatially explicit neutral models therefore have limited descriptive
  power. However, our results suggest that a fatter tail of the dispersal
  kernel seems to improve the fit, suggesting that dispersal kernels with even
  fatter tails should be studied in future. We conclude that more advanced
  spatially explicit models and tools to analyze them need to be developed.%

  We explore the relationship between network structure and dynamics by
  relating the topology of spatial networks with its underlying metapopulation
  abundance. Metapopulation abundance is largely affected by the architecture
  of the spatial network, although this effect depends on demographic
  parameters here represented by the extinction-to-colonization ratio (e/c).
  Thus, for moderate to large e/c-values, regional abundance grows with the
  heterogeneity of the network, with uniform or random networks having the
  lowest regional abundances, and scale-free networks having the largest
  abundance. However, the ranking is reversed for low extinction probabilities,
  with heterogeneous networks showing the lowest relative abundance. We further
  explore the mechanisms underlying such results by relating a node's incidence
  (average number of time steps the node is occupied) with its degree, and with
  the average degree of the nodes it interacts with. These results demonstrate
  the importance of spatial network structure to understanding metapopulation
  abundance, and serve to determine under what circumstances information on
  network structure should be complemented with information on the species
  life-history traits to understand persistence in heterogeneous environments.%

  A fundamental goal of ecology is to understand what controls the distribution
  and abundance of species. Both environmental niches and trade-offs among
  species in dispersal and competitive ability have traditionally been cited as
  determinants of plant community composition. More recently, neutral models
  have shown that communities of species with identical life-history
  characteristics and no adaptation to environmental niches can form spatial
  distribution patterns similar to those found in nature, so long as the
  species have a limited dispersal distance. If there is a strong correlation
  between geographic distance and change in environmental conditions, however,
  such spatial patterns can arise through either neutral or niche-based
  processes. To test these competing theories, we developed a sampling design
  that decoupled distance and environment in the understory plant communities
  of an old-growth, temperate forest. We found strong evidence of
  niche-structuring but almost no support for neutral predictions. Dispersal
  limitation acted in conjunction with environmental gradients to determine
  species' distributions, and both functional and phylogenetic constraints
  appear to contribute to the niche differentiation that structures community
  assembly. Our results indicate that testing a neutral hypothesis without
  accounting for environmental gradients will at best cause unexplained
  variation in plant distributions and may well provide misleading support for
  neutrality because of a correlation between geographic distance and
  environment.%

  Understanding coexistence of highly shade-tolerant tree species is a
  longstanding challenge for forest ecologists. A conceptual model for the
  coexistence of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and American beech (Fagus
  grandibfolia) has been proposed, based on a low-light survival/high-light
  growth trade-off, which interacts with soil fertility and small-scale
  spatiotemporal variation in the environment. In this study, we first tested
  whether the spatial distribution of seedlings and saplings can be predicted
  by the spatiotemporal variability of light availability and soil fertility,
  and second, the manner in which the process of environmental filtering
  changes with regeneration size. We evaluate the support for this hypothesis
  relative to the one for a neutral model, i.e., for seed rain density
  predicted from the distribution of adult trees. To do so, we performed
  intensive sampling over 86 quadrats (5 x 5 m) in a 0.24-ha plot in a mature
  maple-beech community in Quebec, Canada. Maple and beech abundance, soil
  characteristics, light availability, and growth history (used as a proxy for
  spatiotemporal variation in light availability) were finely measured to model
  variation in sapling composition across different size classes. Results
  indicate that the variables selected to model species distribution do
  effectively change with size, but not as predicted by the conceptual model.
  Our results show that variability in the environment is not sufficient to
  differentiate these species' distributions in space. Although species differ
  in their spatial distribution in the small size classes, they tend to
  correlate at the larger size class in which recruitment occurs. Overall, the
  results are not supportive of a model of coexistence based on small-scale
  variations in the environment. We propose that, at the scale of a local
  stand, the lack of fit of the model could result from the high similarity of
  species in the range of environmental conditions encountered, and we suggest
  that coexistence would be stable only at larger spatial scales at which
  variability in the environment is greater.%

  The contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes to species
  coexistence is widely debated. With the introduction of powerful statistical
  techniques, we can now better characterise different sources of uncertainty
  when quantifying niche differentiation. The theoretical literature on the
  effect of stochasticity on coexistence, however, is often ignored by field
  ecologists because of its technical nature and difficulties in its
  application. In this review, we examine how different sources of variability
  in population dynamics contribute to coexistence. Unfortunately, few general
  rules emerge among the different models that have been studied to date.
  Nonetheless, we believe that a greater understanding is possible, based on
  the integration of coexistence and population extinction risk theories. There
  are two conditions for coexistence in the presence of environmental and
  demographic variability: (1) the average per capita growth rates of all
  coexisting species must be positive when at low densities, and (2) these
  growth rates must be strong enough to overcome negative random events
  potentially pushing densities to extinction. We propose that critical tests
  for species coexistence must account for niche differentiation arising from
  this variability and should be based explicitly on notions of stability and
  ecological drift.%

  In this study, we ask if instead of being fundamentally opposed, niche and
  neutral theories could simply be located at the extremes of a continuum.
  First, we present a model of recruitment probabilities that combines both
  niche and neutral processes. From this model, we predict and test whether the
  relative importance of niche vs. neutral processes in controlling community
  dynamics will vary depending on community species richness, niche overlap and
  dispersal capabilities of species (both local and long distance). Results
  demonstrate that niche and neutrality form ends of a continuum from
  competitive to stochastic exclusion. In the absence of immigration,
  competitive exclusion tends to create a regular spacing of niches. However,
  immigration prevents the establishment of a limiting similarity. The
  equilibrium community consists of a set of complementary and redundant
  species, with their abundance determined, respectively, by the distribution
  of environmental conditions and the amount of immigration.%

  We present a theory extending the source-sink concept with an ecosystem
  perspective. We analyze a model for meta-ecosystem dynamics in a
  heterogeneous environment to study how the spatial flows of materials such as
  inorganic nutrients and nutrients sequestered into producers, herbivores, and
  detritus affect the community dynamics. We show that spatial flows of an
  inorganic nutrient (direct nutrient flow) and organic matter (indirect
  nutrient flow) through detritus, producer, or herbivore compartments can
  reverse the source-sink dynamics of a local ecosystem. More precisely, the
  balance between such direct and indirect nutrient flows determines the net
  direction of nutrient flows between two ecosystems of contrasted
  productivities. It allows a sink to turn into a source and vice versa. This
  effect of nutrient flows on source and sink dynamics is robust to the
  ecosystem structure (with and without herbivores) and to specific ecosystem
  compartments contributing to nutrient flows (primary producers, herbivores,
  or detritus). Ecosystems in distinct localities thus interact together with
  the structure at one place influencing that of the other. In meta-ecosystems,
  the source-sink dynamics of an organism is not only constrained by its
  dispersal from the source to the sink, but also by the fertility and
  community composition in the neighborhood responsible for spatial flows of
  nutrients and energy. The meta-ecosystem perspective provides a powerful
  theoretical framework to address novel questions in spatial ecosystem
  ecology.%

  Robert H. Whittaker defined beta diversity as the variation in species
  composition among sites in a geographic area. Beta diversity is a key concept
  for understanding the functioning of ecosystems, for the conservation of
  biodiversity, and for ecosystem management. This paper explains how
  hypotheses about the origin of beta diversity can be tested by partitioning
  the spatial variation of community composition data (presence– absence or
  abundance data) with respect to environmental variables and spatial base
  functions. We compare two statistical methods to accomplish that. The
  sum-of-squares of a community composition data table, which is one possible
  measure of beta diversity, is correctly partitioned by canonical ordination;
  hence, canonical partitioning produces correct estimates of the different
  portions of community composition variation. In recent years, several authors
  interested in the variation in community composition among sites (beta
  diversity) have used another method, variation partitioning o...%

  Keystone species are defined as having disproportionate importance in their
  community. This concept has proved useful and is now often used in
  conservation ecology. Here, we introduce the concept of keystone communities
  (and ecosystems) within metacommunities (and metaecosystems). We define
  keystone and burden communities as communities with impacts
  disproportionately large (positive or negative respectively) relative to
  their weight in the metacommunity. We show how a simple metric, based on the
  effects of single-community removals, can characterise communities along a
  'keystoneness' axis. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach with
  examples from two different theoretical models. We further distinguish
  environmental heterogeneity from species trait heterogeneity as determinants
  of keystoneness. We suggest that the concept of keystone
  communities/ecosystems will be highly beneficial, not only as a fundamental
  step towards understanding species interactions in a spatial context, but
  also as a tool for the management of disturbed landscapes.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Dendritic ecological networks (DENs) are a unique form of ecological networks
  that exhibit a dendritic network topology (e.g. stream and cave networks or
  plant architecture). DENs have a dual spatial representation; as points
  within the network and as points in geographical space. Consequently, some
  analytical methods used to quantify relationships in other types of
  ecological networks, or in 2-D space, may be inadequate for studying the
  influence of structure and connectivity on ecological processes within DENs.
  We propose a conceptual taxonomy of network analysis methods that account for
  DEN characteristics to varying degrees and provide a synthesis of the
  different approaches within the context of stream ecology. Within this
  context, we summarise the key innovations of a new family of spatial
  statistical models that describe spatial relationships in DENs. Finally, we
  discuss how different network analyses may be combined to address more
  complex and novel research questions. While our main focus is streams, the
  taxonomy of network analyses is also relevant anywhere spatial patterns in
  both network and 2-D space can be used to explore the influence of
  multi-scale processes on biota and their habitat (e.g. plant morphology and
  pest infestation, or preferential migration along stream or road corridors).%

  Patterns of species richness and relative abundance at some scales cannot be
  distinguished from predictions of null models, including zero-sum neutral
  models of population change and random speciation-extinction models of
  evolutionary diversification. Both models predict that species richness or
  population abundance produced by independent iterations of the same processes
  in different regions should be uncorrelated. We find instead that the number
  of species and individuals in families of trees in forest plots are strongly
  correlated across Southeast Asia, Africa, and tropical America. These
  correlations imply that deterministic processes influenced by evolutionarily
  conservative family-level traits constrain the number of confamilial tree
  species and individuals that can be supported in regional species pools and
  local assemblages in humid tropical forests.%

  Islands acquire species through immigration and speciation. Models of island
  biogeography should capture both processes; however quantitative island
  biogeography theory has either neglected speciation or treated it
  unrealistically. We introduce a model where the dominance of immigration on
  small and near islands gives way to an increasing role for speciation as
  island area and isolation increase. We examine the contribution of
  immigration and speciation to the avifauna of 35 archipelagoes and find,
  consistent with our model, that the zone of radiation comprises two regions:
  endemic species diverged from mainland sister-species at intermediate
  isolation and from insular sister-species at higher levels of isolation. Our
  model also predicts species-area curves in accord with existing research and
  makes new predictions about species ages and abundances. We argue that a
  paucity of data and theory on species abundances on isolated islands
  highlights the need for island biogeography to be reconnected with mainstream
  ecology.%

  Understanding the maintenance and origin of biodiversity is a formidable
  task, yet many ubiquitous ecological patterns are predicted by a surprisingly
  simple and widely studied neutral model that ignores functional differences
  between species. However, this model assumes that new species arise
  instantaneously as singletons and consequently makes unrealistic predictions
  about species lifetimes, speciation rates and number of rare species. Here,
  we resolve these anomalies - without compromising any of the original model's
  existing achievements and retaining computational and analytical tractability
  - by modelling speciation as a gradual, protracted, process rather than an
  instantaneous event. Our model also makes new predictions about the diversity
  of 'incipient' species and rare species in the metacommunity. We show that it
  is both necessary and straightforward to incorporate protracted speciation in
  future studies of neutral models, and argue that non-neutral models should
  also model speciation as a gradual process rather than an instantaneous one.%

  Ecological neutral theory has elicited strong opinions in recent years. Here,
  we review these opinions and strip away some unfortunate problems with
  semantics to reveal three major underlying questions. Only one of these
  relates to neutral theory and the importance of ecological drift, whereas the
  others involve the link between pattern and process, the tradeoff between
  simplicity and complexity in modeling, and the role of stochasticity and
  drift in ecology. We explain how neutral theory cannot be simultaneously used
  both as a null hypothesis and as an approximation. However, we also show how
  neutral theory always has a valuable use in one of these two roles, even
  though the real world is not neutral.%

  Resource competition is a fundamental interaction in natural communities.
  However, little remains known about competition in spatial environments where
  organisms are able to regulate resource distributions. Here, we analyse the
  competition of two consumers for two resources in a one-dimensional habitat
  in which the resources are supplied from opposite sides. We show that the
  success of an invading species crucially depends on the slope of the resource
  gradients shaped by the resident. Our analysis reveals that parameter
  combinations, which lead to coexistence in a uniform environment, may favour
  alternative stable states in a spatial system, and vice versa. Furthermore,
  differences in growth rate, mortality or dispersal abilities allow a consumer
  to coexist stationarily with - or even outcompete - a competitor with lower
  resource requirements. Applying our theory to a phytoplankton model, we
  explain shifts in the community structure that are induced by environmental
  changes.%

  The species-area relationship (SAR) has been used to predict the numbers of
  species going extinct due to habitat loss, but other researchers have
  maintained that SARs overestimate extinctions and instead one should use the
  endemics-area relationship (EAR) to predict extinctions. Here, we employ
  spatially explicit simulations of large numbers of species in spatially
  heterogeneous landscapes to investigate SARs and extinctions in a dynamic
  context. The EAR gives the number of species going extinct immediately after
  habitat loss, but typically many other species have unviable populations in
  the remaining habitat and go extinct soon afterwards. We conclude that the
  EAR underestimates extinctions due to habitat loss, the continental SAR (with
  slope \~{}0.1 or somewhat less) gives a good approximation of short-term
  extinctions, while the island SAR calculated for discrete fragments of
  habitat (with slope \~{}0.25) predicts the long-term extinctions. However,
  when the remaining area of land-covering habitat such as forest is roughly
  less than 20\% of the total landscape and the habitat is highly fragmented,
  all current SARs underestimate extinction rate. We show how the
  'fragmentation effect' can be incorporated into a predictive SAR model. When
  the remaining habitat is highly fragmented, an effective way to combat the
  fragmentation effect is to aggregate habitat fragments into clusters rather
  than to place them randomly across the landscape.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Stochastic niche theory resolves many of the differences between neutral
  theory and classical tradeoff-based niche theories of resource competition
  and community structure. In stochastic niche theory, invading species become
  established only if propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing
  to maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established species. The
  theory makes three predictions about community structure. First, stochastic
  niche assembly creates communities in which species dominate approximately
  equally wide "slices" of the habitat's spatial heterogeneity. These niche
  widths generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances for
  which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with numerous observations,
  there are strong correlations among species traits, species abundances, and
  environmental conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are
  predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a propagule would
  survive to be an adult. These decreases cause local diversity to be limited
  by the inhibitory effects of resource use by established species on the
  establishment (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or
  disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment limitation, many
  more species could indefinitely coexist. Third, the low invasibility of high
  diversity communities is predicted to result not from diversity per se, but
  from the uniformly low levels of resources that occur in high-diversity
  communities created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction
  provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is the tendency
  for highly diverse regions to be more heavily invaded.%
